## About the Elon Musk Is On Duty

Elon Musk is on Duty is the game that I taught my students to develop during the training I gave at Iztech Children's University so that primary and secondary school students could learn to develop games using Unity.

This game was developed with Visual Scripting, a drag-and-drop library of Unity, so that younger students can understand it more easily.


## Story of the Game

One day, Elon Musk gets angry because things are not going well and he has to fire all his employees. However, in order to repair the broken satellites, someone is needed to take the satellites from the sky and bring them down to earth. Since Elon Musk cannot find anyone around to do this task, he takes responsibility and jumps on the spaceship. The mission is clear: the highest satellite will be taken and brought down to earth!


## Gameplay

The game is played with wasd or arrow keys. You can move up, right and left. If you hit obstacles, you lose the game and have to start over. If you collect the stars on the road during your journey, you will get +10 points for each star, if you take the satellite and land it on the green area, you will get +20 points, if you land it on the yellow area, you will get +40 points, and if you land it on the blue area, you will get +60 points.
